        "In this Jupyter notebook you can play around with the small version (117M) of **Open AI's GPT-2** Model from the paper *[Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf).*\n",
        "\n",
        "According to the authors, the GPT-2 algorithm was trained on the task of *language modeling*--- which tests a program's ability to predict the next word in a given sentence--by ingesting huge numbers of articles, blogs, and websites. By using just this data it achieved state-of-the-art scores on a number of unseen language tests, an achievement known as *zero-shot learning.* It can also perform other writing-related tasks, like translating text from one language to another, summarizing long articles, and answering trivia questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Open AI decided not to release the dataset, training code, or the full GPT-2 model weights. This is due to the concerns about large language models being used to generate deceptive, biased, or abusive language at scale. Some examples of the applications of these models for malicious purposes are:\n",
        "* Generate misleading news articles\n",
        "* Impersonate others online\n",
        "* Automate the production of abusive or faked content to post on social media\n",
        "* Automate the production of spam/phishing content\n",
        "\n",
        "As one can imagine, this combined with recent advances in generation of synthetic imagery, audio, and video implies that it's never been easier to create fake content and spread disinformation at scale. The public at large will need to become more skeptical of the content they consume online. \n",

I am always looking for cool looks with these menswear outfits, especially in winter and in the summer! I do have some very personal favorite items in this pair as well. I am wearing a simple black sweater which I bought as a kid and it was really cool. I have also made a black-and-white striped collar for the winter months as well as a simple white shirt with a black skirt and a white pants. A black shirt and shirt is great because it helps keep all of your winter gear as well as your winter suits. The black jacket is great for all types of winter wear and it makes it easy to wear over winter, as well as being great for getting on with something cold. There were some days I was really looking forward to the winter of 2011 but I’m not totally sold on the pants, but they are also really comfortable. The jeans are great as well for some winter wear and also get you a much more relaxed look. They are also great for carrying out some winter activities such as ice skating or biking. They are a great pair for summer as well! I’m really looking forward to the winter of 2011 and I have only been wearing these pair for a few months, but they are definitely something I would consider wearing over winter. I have worn many pairs of these shoes over the years, and I have always liked the way they play up so much in the winter. These socks are great for getting a little extra attention from the cold and winter weather, and the fit for these socks is perfect for that. I am looking forward to wearing these socks in the winter for the first time. There are many other menswear and prep menswear styles that you can try out if you are looking for some of the menswear styles. If you are looking for someone to wear these menswear for, then I would definitely recommend them!\n",

Also, this style may sound like a bit of a shock to some, as the T-Shirt is just as soft as the original.

Most researchers agree that a superintelligent AI is unlikely to exhibit human emotions like love or hate, and that there is no reason to expect AI to become intentionally benevolent or malevolent. Instead, when considering how AI might become a risk, experts think two scenarios most likely:\n",
            "======================================== SAMPLE 1 ========================================\n",
            " the human species would become a \"genius,\" and the AI would become a \"dangerous\" menace.\n",

            "Some experts believe that our current technologies can solve many of these problems, but others argue that those \"human instincts\" should instead be employed to protect us. Many experts, however, think that the future of AI should be at peace, if at all possible, in AI's design and function. This brings us to one more question: what makes an AI a danger?\n",
            "\n",
            "First and foremost, what would it mean if an AI were not human? In his book The Future of Machines, psychologist and futurist David Daleiden discusses the question of whether an AI is a danger to human beings. He writes:\n",
            "\n",
            "Humans are the most dangerous species on Earth because we are not able to deal with things that are threatening us: the environment, the food, the people. It's time for a new paradigm, technology that will protect us from these things, even if it's not a threat to us at all. We have to change our way of thinking.\n",
            "\n",
            "A recent paper in the journal Nature describes the future of human behavior at the intersection of human biology and AI. In it, researchers from the University of Toronto's Graduate School of Business created a machine learning framework that was able to quickly and securely predict the future actions of humans, in a manner that was both efficient and safe. The researchers then used it to generate a human-level prediction of what future behavior would look like.\n",
            "\n",
            "In doing so, the researchers found several key traits that might be crucial to making AI safer. These traits include the ability to respond to threats, to control their consequences (because they are potentially more dangerous than humans), and to predict whether actions take place (because they might be risky), and to manage them. These traits are important because they can predict the future actions of humans in a way that can make them more likely to act with greater concern for our safety.\n",
            "\n",
            "As it turns out, AI's ability to predict future behavior may be crucial for its own good. We are already seeing a shift in how humans are deployed and deployed around the world by the military. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, \"the level of engagement is increasing for both military (and non-military) use, and for both non-military forces and non-military organizations.\"\n",

            "\"I think the human brain is going to be very powerful on a variety of things,\" said Rolfe. \"People like to think that artificial intelligence is just bad at anything, such as the art of painting or writing. But actually, some of the things that you can do are very good. When you ask a computer what its intelligence is, it usually says 'It loves doing things, loves to play games, loves to talk to people,' but when it says 'It likes to learn, loves to learn, and loves to learn about things' it really doesn't. So it's not very useful to it.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "As Rolfe explained, AI is a huge part of the human experience. \"We are all connected, so we can look at what someone's personality is and think 'Well, my behavior, your behavior is pretty great, but I'm not going to be able to learn what they think I want to learn and understand them,' or 'If I can learn their character from them, they want to learn from me,' or whatever and so on,\" he said. \"And yet this is often pretty terrifying.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "If this is true for us, then even we can't help but question whether the human brain can be as good as our own. If it were, then the human mind would be very good at what it does, and would be much more likely than our own to understand how we think and act.\n",
